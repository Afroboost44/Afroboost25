# TWINT Integration Test Instructions

## Overview
The TWINT payment method has been successfully integrated into your AfroBoost application. Here's how to test it:

## What was implemented:

### 1. Payment Method Types Updated
- Updated `PaymentHandler` and `PaymentHandlerWithCredits` to include TWINT as a payment option
- Added TWINT icon (ðŸ“±) and proper display name
- TWINT is enabled automatically when Stripe is configured

### 2. API Endpoints Created
- `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session` - Creates Stripe Checkout sessions for TWINT payments
- `/api/stripe/verify-session` - Verifies completed payment sessions

### 3. New Components
- `TwintPaymentModal` - Handles TWINT payment flow with payment method selection
- Payment success/cancel pages at `/payment/success` and `/payment/cancel`

### 4. Updated Components

- All payment callbacks updated to include TWINT method type

## Testing Steps:

### 1. Basic Integration Test
1. Navigate to any course page (e.g., `/courses/[courseId]`)
2. Click "Book Course" button
3. In the payment method selection, you should see:
   - ðŸ’³ Credit/Debit Card
   - ðŸ’° PayPal (if configured)
   - ðŸ“± TWINT (if Stripe is configured)

   - Credit/Debit Card (backup option)
4. Click "Pay [amount] CHF"
5. You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout
6. Complete the payment (use Stripe test cards)
7. After successful payment, you'll be redirected back to `/payment/success`

### 3. Test Cards (Stripe Test Mode)
For TWINT testing in Stripe test mode, you can use:
- **Test TWINT**: Use any test card number (TWINT simulation)
- **Test Card**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined Card**: 4000 0000 0000 0002

### 4. Integration Points
TWINT payments are now supported in:
- Course booking (`/courses/[courseId]`)
- Course list booking (`/courses`)
- Shop purchases (`/shop`)
- Credit top-ups
- Any component using `PaymentHandler` or `PaymentHandlerWithCredits`

## Configuration Requirements:

### Stripe Configuration
TWINT requires Stripe to be properly configured in your admin settings:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Settings
2. Configure Stripe with valid API keys
3. Enable Stripe payments
4. TWINT will automatically become available
